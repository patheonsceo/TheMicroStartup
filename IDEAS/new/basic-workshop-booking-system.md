## Overview

Create a simple online form where people can sign up for workshops. This makes it easier to manage registrations and payments than doing everything manually.

---

## Problem Statement

Managing workshop sign-ups through WhatsApp or email gets messy. We need a simple system where people can see available workshops, register, and pay online.

---

## Proposed Solution

Build a basic website page with workshop listings. Add a simple form for each workshop where people can:
- See workshop details (date, time, price, what they'll learn)
- Enter their name, email, phone
- Pay online (using payment link)
- Get confirmation email

Keep it simple - no fancy features needed.

---

## Implementation Plan

1. List all required features (simple list)
2. Build basic webpage (or use simple tool like Google Forms + payment link)
3. Add workshop information
4. Test with a few people
5. Launch and share link
6. Monitor and fix issues

---

## Resources Needed

- Website domain and hosting (₹1,000-2,000 per year)
- Simple website builder or basic coding
- Payment gateway setup (Razorpay or similar - free setup, charges per transaction)
- Email service for confirmations
- Time to build (10-20 hours)

---

## Expected Outcomes

- Easier workshop registration
- Less time spent on manual sign-ups
- Better organization of registrations
- Professional look for Atulya's workshops
- Automatic payment collection

---

## Potential Challenges

- Need to learn basic website setup
- Payment gateway setup can be confusing
- Needs maintenance when workshops change
- People might prefer WhatsApp (need to offer both options)

---

## Open Questions

- Should we build from scratch or use existing tools?
- Do we need a mobile app or is website enough?
- How do we handle refunds if someone cancels?
- Should we start with Google Forms and upgrade later?

## Next Steps

Research simple booking tools. Try Google Forms first to test. Upgrade if needed.
