## Overview

Build connections with local farmers and suppliers to buy fresh ingredients directly. This supports local farmers, gets better quality food, and often costs less than buying from markets.

---

## Problem Statement

Buying food from big markets is expensive and ingredients aren't always fresh. Local farmers have better quality produce at better prices, but we don't know how to connect with them.

---

## Proposed Solution

Find 3-5 local farmers or small suppliers nearby. Visit them or talk on phone. Agree on regular delivery schedule. Start small - maybe just vegetables and fruits. Expand to other items like grains or dairy if it works well.

---

## Implementation Plan

1. Research local farmers in area (search online, ask locals)
2. Visit or call 5-10 farmers
3. Choose 2-3 best ones based on quality and price
4. Set up weekly or bi-weekly delivery schedule
5. Start ordering regularly
6. Build relationship and adjust based on needs

---

## Resources Needed

- Time to research and visit farmers
- Phone/internet for communication
- Vehicle for pickup (or arrange delivery)
- Budget for ingredients (same as market, but better quality)
- Simple tracking system for orders

---

## Expected Outcomes

- Better quality, fresher ingredients
- Lower costs (save 10-20% compared to markets)
- Support local farmers
- Build community connections
- More sustainable food sourcing

---

## Potential Challenges

- Finding reliable farmers
- Coordinating delivery schedule
- Managing orders and payments
- Quality consistency
- What to do when farmers can't deliver

---

## Open Questions

- Which farmers are closest to Atulya's?
- What ingredients should we prioritize (vegetables, fruits, grains)?
- How often should we order (weekly, bi-weekly)?
- Should we pay upfront or after delivery?
- Can farmers deliver or do we need to pick up?

## Related Ideas/Projects

- Community garden (grow our own ingredients)
- Food lab operations (will use these ingredients)

## Next Steps

Search for local farmers near Atulya's location. Make a list and start reaching out.
