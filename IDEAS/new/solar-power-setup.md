## Overview

Install solar panels on Atulya's roof to generate electricity and reduce monthly power bills. Start small with enough panels to cover basic lighting and equipment needs.

---

## Problem Statement

Electricity bills are expensive. Using solar power will reduce monthly costs and make Atulya's more sustainable.

---

## Proposed Solution

Install 5-10 solar panels on the roof. Add batteries to store power for night use. Connect to main power grid as backup when solar isn't enough.

---

## Implementation Plan

1. Get quotes from 2-3 solar installation companies
2. Choose the best option (price + quality)
3. Install panels and batteries
4. Test the system
5. Monitor electricity savings

---

## Resources Needed

- Money for solar panels and installation (₹3-5 lakhs)
- Roof space for panels
- Permission from local authorities if needed
- Someone to maintain the system

---

## Expected Outcomes

- Lower monthly electricity bills (save ₹8,000-12,000 per month)
- More sustainable power source
- Less dependency on grid electricity
- Positive impact on environment

---

## Potential Challenges

- High upfront cost
- Weather dependent (less power on cloudy days)
- Needs regular cleaning of panels
- Battery replacement every few years

---

## Open Questions

- How much power does Atulya's actually need?
- Can we get government subsidies for solar installation?
- What's the best battery type for our needs?
