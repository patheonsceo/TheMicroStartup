## Overview

Set up a simple composting system to turn kitchen food waste into fertilizer. This reduces waste, creates useful compost for the garden, and cuts down on garbage disposal costs.

---

## Problem Statement

Kitchen waste ends up in trash. This costs money to dispose of and creates landfill waste. Instead, we can turn it into compost for the garden.

---

## Proposed Solution

Use 2-3 large compost bins near the kitchen. Collect vegetable peels, fruit scraps, and other food waste. Mix with dry leaves or sawdust. Turn it regularly. In 2-3 months, we'll have compost ready for the garden.

---

## Implementation Plan

1. Buy 2-3 compost bins (₹2,000-4,000 total)
2. Set up bins in a convenient location near kitchen
3. Create simple system for collecting food waste
4. Teach kitchen staff and members how to compost
5. Maintain bins (mix weekly)
6. Use finished compost in garden

---

## Resources Needed

- Compost bins (₹2,000-4,000)
- Dry leaves or sawdust (for mixing)
- Space for bins (small area near kitchen)
- Basic shovel or stick for mixing
- Someone to check on it weekly

---

## Expected Outcomes

- Less kitchen waste in trash
- Free fertilizer for garden
- Lower waste disposal costs
- Better sustainability
- Learning experience for members

---

## Potential Challenges

- Needs regular attention (weekly mixing)
- Can attract insects if not managed properly
- Takes time to make compost (2-3 months)
- Needs education on what can and can't be composted

---

## Open Questions

- What size compost bins do we need?
- Where's the best location for bins?
- Should we use worms in composting (vermicomposting)?
- How do we prevent bad smells?

---

## Related Ideas/Projects

- Community garden (will use the compost)
- Waste management system (broader approach)

---

## Next Steps

Research simple composting methods. Order compost bins. Set up the system.
