## Overview

Organize a monthly online meeting where members can share their ideas, projects, or learnings with others. Keep it casual - just 30-45 minutes. No presentations needed, just friendly sharing.

---

## Problem Statement

Members have ideas and projects but don't always share them. Creating a regular space to share helps people connect, learn from each other, and collaborate.

---

## Proposed Solution

One Saturday evening each month, host a video call (Zoom or Google Meet). Invite all members. Anyone can share:
- An idea they're working on
- A project they completed
- Something they learned
- Ask for help or feedback

Keep it informal - 2-3 minutes per person, no slides needed.

---

## Implementation Plan

1. Choose a date (maybe first Saturday of each month)
2. Set up video call link
3. Send reminder to members (one week before, one day before)
4. Host the session (welcome everyone, let people share)
5. Take notes on ideas shared
6. Follow up on any collaborations

---

## Resources Needed

- Video call platform (free - Zoom, Google Meet)
- Time to host (30-45 minutes monthly)
- Reminder system (email or WhatsApp)
- Simple note-taking during session

---

## Expected Outcomes

- Members connect and share ideas
- People learn from each other
- Ideas get feedback and support
- Potential collaborations form
- Stronger community bonds

---

## Potential Challenges

- Getting people to attend
- Time zone differences (if members are in different places)
- Keeping it short and casual
- Managing multiple people wanting to speak

---

## Open Questions

- What day and time works best for most members?
- Should it be online only or also in-person when Atulya's is ready?
- How do we encourage shy members to participate?
- Should we record sessions for people who can't attend?

---

## Related Ideas/Projects

- EightEngine integration (can use platform for this)
- Community engagement initiatives

---

## Next Steps

Announce first session to members. Set up video call link. Try it once and get feedback.
