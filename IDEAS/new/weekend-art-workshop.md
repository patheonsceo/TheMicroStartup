## Overview

Organize monthly art workshops on weekends. Teach basic drawing, painting, or digital art skills. Charge a small fee (₹1,500-2,500 per person) to cover costs and generate revenue.

---

## Problem Statement

Many people want to learn art but don't know where to start. Weekend workshops provide an opportunity to learn, create, and connect with others.

---

## Proposed Solution

Run 1-2 art workshops per month on Saturdays. Each workshop lasts 3-4 hours. Focus on one skill per workshop (like basic drawing, watercolor painting, or digital art basics). Keep it simple and beginner-friendly.

---

## Implementation Plan

1. Decide on workshop topics (start with most popular)
2. Find an art teacher or experienced artist to lead
3. Create simple workshop schedule
4. Set up art lab space with tables and supplies
5. Announce workshops in community
6. Collect registration and payments
7. Run first workshop
8. Get feedback and improve
