## Overview

Create a small garden at Atulya's where members can grow vegetables, herbs, and fruits. This provides fresh food for the kitchen and teaches people about growing food.

---

## Problem Statement

Buying vegetables and herbs from markets is expensive. Growing our own food would reduce costs, provide fresh ingredients, and create a learning experience for everyone.

---

## Proposed Solution

Set aside an area (maybe 500-800 square feet) for a garden. Start with easy-to-grow items like tomatoes, okra, spinach, mint, and coriander. Use composting from kitchen waste as fertilizer.

---

## Implementation Plan

1. Choose a good spot with enough sunlight
2. Prepare the soil (remove weeds, add compost)
3. Build small raised beds or plant directly in ground
4. Plant seeds or small plants
5. Create watering schedule
6. Teach members how to maintain it

---

## Resources Needed

- Space for garden (500-800 sq ft)
- Seeds or small plants (₹2,000-5,000 to start)
- Basic gardening tools (₹3,000-5,000)
- Soil and compost
- Water access
- Someone to coordinate (can rotate among members)

---

## Expected Outcomes

- Fresh vegetables and herbs for the kitchen
- Lower food costs (save ₹2,000-4,000 per month)
- Learning experience for members
- Better connection with nature
- Compost from kitchen waste can fertilize the garden

---

## Potential Challenges

- Needs daily watering and care
- Pests might damage plants
- Weather affects growth
- Requires commitment from members

---

## Open Questions

- Which vegetables grow best in this area?
- How much time does daily maintenance take?
- Can we use rainwater for irrigation?
- Should we start small and expand later?

---

## Related Ideas/Projects

- Composting system (to create fertilizer for garden)
- Rainwater harvesting (to water the garden)

---

## Next Steps

Survey the available space and check soil quality. Start with 2-3 easy vegetables.
